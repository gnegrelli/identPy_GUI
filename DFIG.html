<h1>Doubly-Fed Induction Generator Model</h1>
<p>Proposed by <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6345508">Erlich et al., 2012 </a>, this mathematical model is able to represent the dynamic behaviour of both Type-3 and -4 WTGs and can be applied on simulation of entire wind power plants. Since this model is used for transient stability studies, it is assumed that wind speed and, consequently, mechanical power are constant during that interval.</p>
<p>In this model, WPPs are represented by their Thevenin equivalent, composed of  a voltage source connected to the grid by an and impedance. The direct and quadrature components of the equivalent voltage source are controlled by a series of blocks that simulate the controllers of WTGs.</p>
