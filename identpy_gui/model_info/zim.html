<h1>Linearized Z-IM Load Model</h1>
<p>The Linearized Z-IM Load Model is a set of mathematical equations used to predict the behaviour of electrical loads during grid disturbances.</p>
<p>This model is composed of an impedance in parallel with a third-order induction motor (IM). According to <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1709013">Choi et al., 2006</a>, this model is able to correctly represent electrical loads while having a reduced set of parameters. The linearized version is applied when the magnitude of disturbance is considerably small, i.e. during on-load tap changes.</p>
