<h1>Spring-Mass Model</h1>
<p>The spring-mass system is a simple mathematical model often used as example of dynamic systems.</p>
<p>It is composed of an object of mass m connected to a fixed point in space by a spring of stiffness constant k. The mass is on a surface with no friction and oscillates when disturbed by an external force F.</p>
