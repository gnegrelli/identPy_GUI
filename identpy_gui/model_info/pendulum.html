<h1>Pendulum Model</h1>
<p>The pendulum system is a simple mathematical model often used as example of dynamic systems.</p>
<p>It is composed of an object of mass m suspended by a cable of length l so that it can swing in space under the influence of gravity g and air resistance b. An external force F is applied to the mass, what makes it oscillate.</p>
